# Problem 1
This code finds the smallest number in an array by iterating through each element in the array and checking if it's smaller than the current minimum. If it is, the minimum value is updated. Finally, the minimum value is returned. The program prompts the user to input the number of elements and the elements themselves using Scanner.
