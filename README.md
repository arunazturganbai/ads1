# Problem 1 (FindMin file)
This code finds minimum number in an array by iterating through each element in the array and checking if it's smaller than the current minimum. If it is, the minimum value is updated. Finally, the minimum value is returned. The program prompts the user to input the number of elements and the elements themselves using Scanner.
# Problem 2 (FindAver file)
This program asks the user to input the number of elements in an array and the elements themselves. It then calculates and prints the average of the elements using a separate method called "calculateAverage".
# Problem 3 (PrimeNum file)
This code takes an input number from the user and checks if it is a prime number or not. It uses a separate class called "PrimeChecker" that contains a method to check if a number is prime.
